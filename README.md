I created this application for local recovery groups (AA/NA) as a way to post meetings, link resources, etc. This application is
still in development and I'm adding new features daily.

HOW TO RUN:
- Since this using SQLite with a .Migrate() function, you should be able to clone the repository and run it as is.


TO DO:
- Create custom register page
- Change fields in "Profile" (include sobriety date, birthdate, etc)
